<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The a9s MySQL for Pivotal Platform tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. Do not use this product in a Pivotal Platform production environment.</p>

This documentation describes the a9s MySQL for Pivotal Platform tile.
a9s MySQL for Pivotal Platform enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based dedicated MySQL servers
and clusters. Developers can create clustered and single node MySQL service
instances, using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface, and
bind them to apps. A service instance may be associated with a single dedicated
VM or a cluster spread across multiple VMs. You can choose between single VM and
clustered MySQL services instances with service plans.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

When you run the cf CLI `create-service a9s-MySQL` command, Pivotal Platform creates dedicated
VMs for this service instance. This provides protection from bad neighbors.

MySQL service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely
automated. This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded
by infrastructure virtualization mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service instances allocate
infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service instances
are destroyed. Using on-demand, provisioning the number of service instances is
not limited by design.

Distributed across multiple infrastructure availability zones, clustered data service plans enable short failover times and are resilient against failures of individual infrastructure hosts or entire availability zones.
