<p class="note warning">
<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>
The a9s MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.
</p>

This documentation describes the a9s MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile. a9s MySQL for PCF
enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based dedicated MySQL servers and clusters. Developers can create clustered and single node MySQL service instances, using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface, and bind them to apps.
A service instance may be associated with a single dedicated VM or a cluster spread across multiple VMs. You can choose, between single VM and clustered MySQL services instances, with service plans.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

When you run the cf CLI ```create-service a9s-MySQL``` command,
PCF creates dedicated VMs for this service instance. This provides
protection from bad neighbors.

MySQL service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely automated.
This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by infrastructure virtualization
mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service
instances allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service
instances are destroyed. Using on-demand, provisioning the number of
service instances is not limited by design.

Distributed across multiple infrastructure availability zones,  clustered data
service plans enable short failover times and are resilient against
failures of individual infrastructure hosts or entire availability zones.
