owner: Partners
---


## <a id="2-1-1"></a> v2.1.1

**Release Date:** March 7, 2019

**Added**
* a9s Backup Manager: Enable compression for backups. gzip is used for the
  compression.
* a9s Deployer: Add helper script
  /var/vcap/jobs/anynines-bosh-deployer/bin/rails_c to easily open Rails
  console.

**Updated**
* a9s Service Guard: Remove the App Restarter from a9s Service Guard manifest
  because the App Restarter is not usable with the current Cloud Foundry
  Diego cells.
* a9s Service Broker: Optimized response times for provision and deprovision
  endpoints. Previously those requests could take longer than one minute
  causing timeouts in CF.
* Service Dashboard: Optimize communication with a9s Service Broker.
* Logstash: Configure Logstash to watch the a9s Parachute path too.
* a9s Consul: Register consul agent as BOSH DNS handler entry instead of adding
  as resolver when using within PCF tiles.
* Use timeout when connecting to service instances with the MySQL SPI.
* all services: remove recreate and restart button from dashboard

**Fixed**
* a9s Service Broker: Fix database migration if service instances
  are being provisioned/updated during migration.
* a9s Service Broker: Broker does not create one log file for each operation.
  Previously these log files has not been deleted by log rotate since they
  never reached the configured size. This ended in a full disk because of a
  lot of small files.
* a9s Deployer: Does not force the deployment deletion if an error occured.
  Under certain circumstances, it was possible that orphaned deployments remain
  in the IaaS Layer if an error occured while deleting the deployment.
* all services: a9s Service Broker: set the instance state to failed if an
  error is thrown during a provision job.
